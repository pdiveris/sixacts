## Six Proposals

_Six Acts’_ mission is to empower people to take the initiative to design ways to improve the way democracy is conducted. We’re an open platform because we believe democracy belongs to everybody and people with different backgrounds and perspectives should participate in the conversation.

The site and app are being developed by Petros Diveris in partnership with Bentleyworks Ltd.
The code the site and app is open source and it's hybrid, based on React and Laravel in the back end.

Please take a look at the Wiki area for documentaiton specific to the front-end and the overall architecture.
