                <p>
                    Six Acts’ mission is to empower people to take the initiative to design ways to improve the way
                    democracy is conducted. We’re an open platform because we believe democracy belongs to everybody
                    and people with different backgrounds and perspectives should participate in the conversation.
                    We do need rules to keep the platform safe for you, us and the community. These Terms of Service
                    outline rights and responsibilities related to our platform and services.

                <p>
                    You need an account for most activities on the Platform. Keep your password somewhere safe, because
                    you’re responsible for all activity associated with your profile. If you suspect someone else is using
                    your account, let us know. You have to be at least 16 years or older to use Six Acts.
                    When you sign or create a petition via our platform, an account is created for you. All your comments,
                    voting and submitting activities are then tied to this account.<br/>
                    When setting up your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, including a valid
                    email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your
                    account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account
                    without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer
                    your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission. Inform us
                    immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission by
                    contacting us via our email <a href="mailto: thesixacts@gmail.com">thesixacts@gmail.com</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Six Acts platform is for people who are at least 16 years of age. If you are younger than 16 you
                    may not set up an account by yourself, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to particpate
                    in the poll on your behalf. If we discover that you have created an account and you are younger than 16,
                    we will terminate your account
                </p>

                <h2 class="title is-4">2. User content rules</h2>
                <p>
                    You’re responsible for what you post on Six Acts. You should keep your proposals and comments in line
                    with our <a href="/nine_rules">9 Rules for the 6 Acts</a> document and the law, and respect the
                    intellectual property rights of  others. It’s not something we want to do, but we can terminate your
                    account for repeated or major offenses.

                    If we are put on notice that your content violates the law or the rights of
                    others (for example, if it is established that it is defamatory or violates privacy, intellectual
                    property or publicity rights or others), if we discover that your content violates our Community
                    Guidelines, or if we believe your content is inappropriate or objectionable, we may remove it from
                    our platform, or we may make edits to bring your content into compliance. In the vast majority of
                    cases, we will notify you and try to work with you to fix the issue before we take any of these actions
                    (but we are not obligated to).<br/>
                    Six Acts has discretion in enforcing these Terms. We may terminate or suspend your permission to use
                    our platform and services or disable your account at any time, and with or without notice, for any
                    material or repeated violation of these Terms, for unexpected technical issues or problems, or for
                    engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities. Upon any such termination we may delete your
                    account, passwords and content and we may prevent you from further access to the platform and use of
                    our services. Your content may still be available on the platform even if your account is terminated
                    or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of
                    your account, removal of your content or blocking of your access to our platform and services.

                <p>
                    You retain ownership of content you post to Six Acts, but you should make sure you’re allowed to share
                    it. We’re allowed to make versions of your content publicly available to anyone through any media, and
                    others can do the same. Be sure to make backups of your work too.

                    Any content you submit or post on Six Acts
                    is likely to be publicly available, including all reform proposals you submit or vote on and your

                    Six Acts community members, or people you don’t know, seeing a particular message or other content of
                    yours, please do not post it. If you do not wish to have your name publicly displayed in connection

                    However, you authorise us to share this content with anyone, distribute it on any platform and in any
                    media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit (e.g. for clarity or optimisation
                    purposes). For example, we may shorten a submission title for it to appear on our website or share the
                    content with interested media. You also authorise us to allow others to do the same with your content.
                    In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the Six Acts platform, you grant us a

                    distribution or publication of content on other media. You represent and warrant that you have all

                    may not make any modifications, and you may not remove any attributions. When you post content to any
                    third party service through the features and functionalities of our platform (such as our apps or API),

                    under these Terms, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights, and we may decide to enforce them
                    at a later date. These Terms, and any rights and licenses granted under these Terms, may not be
                    transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by us to another company or person without
                    restriction. We won’t be liable to you for any delay or failure to perform any obligation we have under
                    these Terms if the delay or failure is due to events which are beyond our reasonable control, including
                    but not limited to any strike, blockade, war, act of terrorism, riot, natural disaster, failure or
                    diminishment of power or of telecommunications or data networks or services, or refusal of approval or
                    a license by a government agency.

                <p>
                    One of the principles behind Six Acts is that people can interact with decision makers directly and come
                    to solutions together. If you have a serious disagreement with a decision we make, let’s agree to sort it
                    out with each other before we make claims in court.
                    Six Acts is a Uk-based initiative and these Terms are governed by laws of the United Kingdom without
                    regard to their conflict of law principles. If a court having proper authority decides that any portion of
                    these terms, policies and guidelines is invalid, only the part that is invalid will not apply and the rest will
                    still be in effect. The official language of these Terms is English. If there is a conflict between the English
                    language version and any translation, the English language version will prevail.
                    In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to these Terms or
                    an alleged breach thereof, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, between you and us, we shall
                    use our respective best efforts to settle the dispute. If a dispute arises, the complaining party shall
                    provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled “Notice of Dispute,”
                    specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute. Please mail any Notice of Dispute to our head

                    of the dispute that is satisfactory to both parties. If the parties are unable to reach a resolution of the
