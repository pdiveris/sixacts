            <p>
                Six Acts’ mission is to empower people to take the initiative to design ways to improve the way
                democracy is conducted. We’re an open platform because we believe democracy belongs to everybody
                and people with different backgrounds and perspectives should participate in the conversation.
                We do need rules to keep the platform safe for you, us and the community. These Terms of Service
                outline rights and responsibilities related to our platform and services.

            <p>
                You need an account for most activities on the Platform. Keep your password somewhere safe, because
                you’re responsible for all activity associated with your profile. If you suspect someone else is using
                your account, let us know. You have to be at least 16 years or older to use Six Acts.
                When you sign or create a petition via our platform, an account is created for you. All your comments,
                voting and submitting activities are then tied to this account.<br/>
                When setting up your account, you must provide accurate and complete information, including a valid
                email address. You have complete responsibility for your account and everything that happens on your
                account, including for any harm or damage (to us or anyone else) caused by someone using your account
                without your permission. This means you need to be careful with your password. You may not transfer
                your account to someone else or use someone else’s account without their permission. Inform us
                immediately upon learning that someone else may be using your account without your permission by
                contacting us via our email <a href="mailto: thesixacts@gmail.com">thesixacts@gmail.com</a>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Six Acts platform is for people who are at least 16 years of age. If you are younger than 16 you
                may not set up an account by yourself, but we encourage you to invite a parent or guardian to particpate
                in the poll on your behalf. If we discover that you have created an account and you are younger than 16,
                we will terminate your account
            </p>

            <h2 class="title is-4">2. User content rules</h2>
            <p>
                You’re responsible for what you post on Six Acts. You should keep your campaigns and comments in line
                with our 9 Rules for the 6 Acts document and the law, and respect the intellectual property rights of
                others. It’s not something we want to do, but we can terminate your account for repeated or major
                offenses.
            </p>
            <p class="u-mtop-10">
                <strong>Follow our Community Guidelines:</strong>
                When posting content you must follow the 9 Rules for the 6 Acts document

            <p class="u-mtop-10">
                <strong>Abide by the law and respect rights of others:</strong>
                You cannot post any content that violates applicable
                local or national laws of your country, or international laws or regulations. You are solely responsible
                for any content you post via the Six Acts platform and the consequences of posting it.

                <strong>Enforcement by Six Acts: </strong>
                If we are put on notice that your content violates the law or the rights of
                others (for example, if it is established that it is defamatory or violates privacy, intellectual
                property or publicity rights or others), if we discover that your content violates our Community
                Guidelines, or if we believe your content is inappropriate or objectionable, we may remove it from
                our platform, or we may make edits to bring your content into compliance. In the vast majority of
                cases, we will notify you and try to work with you to fix the issue before we take any of these actions
                (but we are not obligated to).<br/>
                Six Acts has discretion in enforcing these Terms. We may terminate or suspend your permission to use
                our platform and services or disable your account at any time, and with or without notice, for any
                material or repeated violation of these Terms, for unexpected technical issues or problems, or for
                engagement by you in fraudulent or illegal activities. Upon any such termination we may delete your
                account, passwords and content and we may prevent you from further access to the platform and use of
                our services. Your content may still be available on the platform even if your account is terminated
                or suspended. You agree that we will have no liability to you or any third party for termination of
                your account, removal of your content or blocking of your access to our platform and services.

            <p>
                You retain ownership of content you post to Six Acts, but you should make sure you’re allowed to share
                it. We’re allowed to make versions of your content publicly available to anyone through any media, and
                others can do the same. Be sure to make backups of your work too.

                <strong>The content you submit on the platform is not confidential:</strong>
                Any content you submit or post on Six Acts
                is likely to be publicly available, including all reform proposals you submit or vote on and your
                comments (on the Six Acts site, in apps and in social media pages). If you are concerned about other
                Six Acts community members, or people you don’t know, seeing a particular message or other content of
                yours, please do not post it. If you do not wish to have your name publicly displayed in connection
                with a particular petition, <em>you may select the option not to display your name publicly</em>. Please
                check

                <strong>The content you post remains yours, and you also allow us to reuse and share it:</strong>
                By submitting and posting content, you do not lose any ownership rights you may have in your content.
                However, you authorise us to share this content with anyone, distribute it on any platform and in any
                media, and to make modifications or edits to it as we see fit (e.g. for clarity or optimisation
                purposes). For example, we may shorten a submission title for it to appear on our website or share the
                content with interested media. You also authorise us to allow others to do the same with your content.
                In legal language, by submitting or posting content on or through the Six Acts platform, you grant us a
                worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license (with the right to sublicense) to use, copy, reproduce,
                process, adapt, modify, publish, transmit, display and distribute your content in any and all media or
                distribution methods (existing now or later developed). This includes making your content available to
                other companies, organisations or individuals who partner with Six Acts for the syndication, broadcast,
                distribution or publication of content on other media. You represent and warrant that you have all
                the rights, power and authority necessary to authorise us to use any content that you submit. You also
                agree to all such uses of your content with no compensation paid to you.

                share via email, or otherwise copy and share individual reform submissions of interest to you, but
                only for informational, non-commercial purposes. If you share another user’s reform submissions you
                may not make any modifications, and you may not remove any attributions. When you post content to any
                third party service through the features and functionalities of our platform (such as our apps or API),
                you will be subject to the terms of that third party service. If you want to remove any submissions or
                content from a third party service, you should contact that third party service and request removal
                directly from them.

            <p>
                One of the principles behind Six Acts is that people can interact with decision makers directly and
                come to solutions together. If you have a serious disagreement with a decision we make, let’s agree to
                sort it out with each other before we make claims in court.
            </p>
            <p>
                Six Acts is a Uk-based initiative and these Terms are governed by laws of the United Kingdom without
                regard to their conflict of law principles. If a court having proper authority decides that any portion
                of these terms, policies and guidelines is invalid, only the part that is invalid will not apply and the
                rest will still be in effect. The official language of these Terms is English. If there is a conflict
                between the English language version and any translation, the English language version will prevail.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement arising from or relating to these Terms
                or an alleged breach thereof, whether arising in contract, tort or otherwise, between you and us, we
                shall use our respective best efforts to settle the dispute. If a dispute arises, the complaining party
                shall provide written notice to the other party in a document specifically entitled “Notice of Dispute,”
                specifically setting forth the precise nature of the dispute.

            <p>
                The possibilities for what people may do with a free, online platform that people everywhere can use to
                create change are endless. Like other platforms where people can post content, these Terms give us
                legal protection from the countless things that could happen.

                While we’re working hard to build an amazing free platform for people everywhere, we can’t make you any
                promises that it will always work perfectly or that we’ll maintain all our services forever.

                No waiver, assignment: If we waive any of our rights in any particular instance, it does not mean that

                time under these Terms, it does not mean that we are waiving our rights, and we may decide to enforce

                    As is service: Use of the Six Acts platform is at your own risk.
                    The platform (including the content you find on it) is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE”
                    basis.
                    Six Acts and its affiliates, suppliers, partners and agents expressly disclaim all warranties of any
                    kind, whether express or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties of title,
                    merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose and non-infringement.
                    Furthermore, Six Acts and its affiliates, suppliers, partners and agents make no warranty that
                    (i) its platform or any products or services provided through the platform will meet your
                    requirements;
                    (ii) the platform will be uninterrupted, timely, secure or error-free or that Six Acts will fix any
                    errors;
                    (iii) you will obtain any specific results from use of the platform; or
                    (iv) any content on the platform is accurate, complete, reliable, current or error-free.
                    Any content obtained through use of the platform is obtained at your own discretion and risk and
                    Six Acts shall not be responsible for any damage caused to your computer or data or for any bugs,
                    viruses, Trojan horses or other destructive code resulting from use of the platform or any content
                    obtained from the platform. Some countries do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the
                    above exclusion may not apply to you. You may also have other legal rights, which vary from
                    country to country.

                    suppliers, partners and agents have no obligation or liability (whether arising in contract,
                    warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise) for any indirect,

                    Six Acts platform or service, even if we have been advised of the possibility of such damages in
                    advance. This limitation applies to damages arising from (i) your use or inability to use the
                    platform and access the services; (ii) cost of procurement of substitute products or services;
                    (iii) unauthorised access to or alteration or distribution of content you submit through the

                    Some countries and states do not allow the limitation or exclusion of incidental, consequential
                    or other types of damages, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.
