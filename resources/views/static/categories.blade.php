                <p>
                    <strong>
                    There are mutiple issues concerning the health of democratic systems, all of which
                    need to be addressed. To achieve a final document that covers the majority of these,
                    we have spread the scope for policy proposals into the following broad categories...
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <h2 class="title is-4">1. Voting and Voting Systems</h2>
                <p>
                    Policy proposals that address the way elections are conducted, such as who votes, how
                    voting happens, when voting happens, and how voting results are recognized and applied.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title is-4">2. Governance and Political Conduct</h2>
                <p>
                    How elected representatives organise themselves, interact, debate issues, make decisions
                    and the rules for re-election. Transparency, discosure of interests and the means by which
                    those elected are held to account.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title is-4">3. Ensuring the Accuracy of Political Information</h2>
                <p>
                    New legislation aimed at preventing or curbing the spread of misinformation that impacts
                    political choices, and at raising the quality of information used to justify policy making.
                    This should include addressing the influence and integrity of both old and new media,
                    e.g. limiting monopolistic control or creating the right to challenge deliberately
                    misleading claims.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title is-4">4. Economic and Financial Influences</h2>
                <p>
                    The moderating or curtailing of external economic influences which interfere with or
                    unduly influence democratic structures and processes. Increasing the democratisation of
                    businesses, economic structures, economic policy-making, monetary systems, and the
                    banking / finance industries.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title is-4">5. Citizen Participation</h2>
                <p>
                    Policies to spread and increase the effectiveness of community led, non-governmental
                    democratic routes of influence.
                </p>
                <h2 class="title is-4">6. Other</h2>
                <p>
                    Any proposals outside the scope of the other categories.
                </p>
