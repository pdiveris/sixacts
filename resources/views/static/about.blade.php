                    <i>We are creating a crowd-sourced mandate for democratic reform, made up of the
                        ideas you submit to this site. The most popular proposals in each category will form
                        the final document- The Six Acts to Reboot Democracy.

                    <ol>
                        <li>We want YOUR ideas for how to reform democracy.</li>
                            We invite you to submit your ideas in the form of proposals for reform to this site.
                        <li>We want you to vote on any existing proposals that you would like to see enacted.</li>
                        <li>We want you to encourage others to participate in the same way.</li>

                <h4 class="is-4"><i>Why are we doing this?</i></h4>
                <p>
                    The 200th anniversary of the Peterloo Massacre has fallen at a time of mass democratic
                    disillusionment, both in the UK and other parts of the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The memory of Peterloo challenges us to confront tough questions about what we've done with
                    the democratic legacy we inherited from the 1819 reformers, and to take action to defend,
                    strengthen and spread the right to self determination.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Despite the definite improvements to peoples' lives, an alarming percentage of the population
                    feels that our current democratic system is failing us, and is not fit for purpose. Bold new ideas to
                    reverse this decline are urgently needed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We believe that the success of democracy relies on constant vigilance by an active population who
                    are committed to maintaining and upgrading a system that will serve us for centuries to come.
                </p>
                <h4 class="is-4"><i>What we hope to achieve</i></h4>
                <p>
                    We want to see an urgent and fundamental discussion about modern democratic reform. We
                    believe this is a debate that's crucial to the future of democracy, and needs to happen now, in
                    order to act as a focus for positive change.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will be collecting and voting on proposals from the <strong>17th August to the 23rd November 2019
                    </strong> and releasing updates ('snapshots') of the most popular Six Acts to date at intervals
                    throughout 2019. We hope this will maintain engagement and emphasise the developing nature of the
                    document.
                </p>
                <h4 class="is-4"><i>The End Product</i></h4>
                <p>
                    Following the Peterloo Massacre in 1819, a wave of protests erupted around England. In response,
                    the UK Parliament reconvened on the 23rd November 1819, when it was presented with Home
                    Secretary Lord Sidmouth's proposed Six Acts: Oppressive new legislation aimed at crushing the
                    democratic uprising.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Our project will come to a conclusion on the same date,</strong> 200 years later, and
                    aims to achieve the  exact opposite. The most popular six proposals to emerge through our online
                    poll will form the basis of the final 2019 Six Acts to Reboot Democracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The end document will be a single-page mandate from participants which articulates our demands
                    for democratic reform. We invite the media, campaign groups, organisations, individuals and
                    politicians to cite, publicise and adopt these Six Acts as a basis for policy-making or further
                    research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Six Acts document will also serve as a position statement or manifesto that groups and
                    individuals can sign up to and endorse, as well as being adapted into a petition to be presented to
                    the Petitions Committee for debate in Parliament.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All of the proposals submitted to the poll will be preserved on the site as an archive for future
                    debate and reference.
