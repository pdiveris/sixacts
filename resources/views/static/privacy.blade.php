            <h2 class="subtitle">Legal &amp; administrative obligations</h2>
            <p>
                We may use and disclose your personal information as necessary or appropriate, especially when we have
                a legal obligation or legitimate interest to do so:
            </p>
            <p>
                •	Fraud prevention: We may use and disclose the information we collect from and about our users as
                we believe necessary to investigate, prevent, or respond to suspected illegal or fraudulent activity
                or to protect the safety, privacy, rights, or property of us, our users, or others.
            </p>
            <p>
                •	Law enforcement purposes: If requested or required by government authorities such as law
                enforcement authorities, courts, regulators, or otherwise to comply with the law
                (which may include laws outside your country of residence), we may have to disclose information we have
                about our users. We also may use and disclose information collected about you in order to exercise

            <p>
                When you vote or submit a reform proposal via our Six Acts platform, an account is created for you.
                Your account will not be visible to the public. Your name or user ID will appear publicly on any reform
                proposals you submit and your votes will be recorded for internal use to ensure that you only vote for
                any proposal once. We may still send you important administrative messages (such as questions or alerts
                about your reform submission).
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">b. Accessing or deleting your information</h2>
            <p>
                If you would like to request to review, correct, update, suppress, or delete personal information that
                has been previously provided to us by you, you may contact us directly by email thesixacts@gmail.com
                and ask us to specify what personal information we have about you and to delete certain personal
                information about you from our records, or request to receive an electronic copy of your personal
                information for purposes of transmitting it to another company (to the extent this right to data
                portability is provided to you by applicable law). Please let us know what information you would like
                us to remove from our databases or otherwise let us know what limitations you would like to put on our
                use of your personal information. For your protection, we may only implement requests with respect to
                the personal information associated with the particular email address that you use to send us your
                request, and we may need to verify your identity before implementing your request. We will respond to
                your requests consistent with applicable law, and we will try to comply with your request as soon as
                reasonably practicable. Please note that in order to delete all of your information we will also need
                to delete any reform proposals you have submitted or voted on, along with any votes corresponding to a
                reform proposal that you have submitted.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">c. Social media</h2>
            <p>
                You can edit or remove the permissions you have granted to Six Acts to use information from your social
                media accounts by using your application privacy settings on your social media account If you have
                signed in to Six Acts through Facebook connect, you are likely to have been cookied by Facebook.
                You can modify or change those cookies through the settings on your Facebook account.
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">d. Third-party analytics companies & Cookies</h2>
            <p>
                We have provided details on the cookies we use and instructions for how you can opt out of these in our
                Cookies policy.

            <h2 class="subtitle">5. Data retention & security</h2>
            <p>
                We take a lot of measures to protect your personal information. If you suspect someone else is using
                your account, let us know by contacting thesixacts@gmail.com
                We seek to use reasonable organisational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your
                personal information within our organisation from loss, misuse, unauthorised access or disclosure,
                alteration and/or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed
                to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure
                (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised),
                please immediately notify our Data Protection Team by contacting thesixacts@gmail.com
            </p>
            <p>
                We will retain your Personal Information for as long as needed or permitted in light of the purposes
                for which it was obtained. The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the length of
                time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide our services to you, our legal obligations
                or whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable
                statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).
            </p>
            <h2 class="subtitle">6. Cross-border transfers</h2>
            <p>
                Six Acts is a UK-based initiative, so if you are not a UK resident your information may be transferred
                across borders when you use the Platform. We have put in place measures to comply with laws regulating
                cross-border transfers.
                By using the platform you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the UK which may
                have different data protection rules from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts,
                law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in the UK  may be entitled to
                access your personal information.
            </p>
