                    the information we may collect about you, depending on your activities on the platform, and how
                    we obtain this information.

                <p>
                    •	All information you post on our platform in the form of reform proposals and comments will
                    be visible to other users. If you choose to send messages or connect with others through our
                    platform about submissions  you have submitted, voted for or shared, you disclose your personal
                    information to the recipient of your message. Our platform provides an open forum for communication by
                    users all around the world. <strong>We do not monitor, verify, or perform any background checks
                    on people submitting reform proposals, voters, or other users of Six Acts.</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    •	We consider an online voting platform to be a public expression of support for an issue.
                    Therefore, your name, general geographic location (postcode, country), and a link to your Six Acts
                    user profile may be displayed on the landing page for any reform proposal you submit, and on related
                    areas of our platform. This information will be viewable to any visitor, including the media,
                    search engines, and other organisations that provide archival internet activities. If you do not wish
                    to have your vote or submission for a reform to be public, we recommend you do not participate
                    in the poll.
                </p>
                <p>
                    •	Your first name, last name, country and/or postcode, and the day that you voted or submitted
                    a reform proposal will be visible to administrators and moderators of the site. This is extremely
                    important for moderators to demonstrate the legitimacy of respondents and to contact you with
                    questions about your submission if necessary. <strong>If you do not wish to have this information
                        shared with site administrators and moderators please do not participate in the poll.</strong>

                    We may use and disclose your personal information as necessary or appropriate, especially when we have

                    (which may include laws outside your country of residence), we may have to disclose information we have
                    about our users. We also may use and disclose information collected about you in order to exercise

                <p>
                    When you vote or submit a reform proposal via our Six Acts platform, an account is created for you.
                    Your account will not be visible to the public. Your name or user ID will appear publicly on any reform
                    proposals you submit and your votes will be recorded for internal use to ensure that you only vote for
                    any proposal once. We may still send you important administrative messages (such as questions or alerts
                    about your reform submission).

                <p>
                    We take a lot of measures to protect your personal information. If you suspect someone else is using
                    your account, let us know by contacting thesixacts@gmail.com
                    We seek to use reasonable organisational, technical, and administrative measures to protect your

                    alteration and/or destruction. Unfortunately, no data transmission or storage system can be guaranteed
                    to be 100% secure. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure
                    (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised),
                    please immediately notify our Data Protection Team by contacting thesixacts@gmail.com
                </p>

                    time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide our services to you, our legal obligations
                    or whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to applicable
                    statutes of limitations, litigation or regulatory investigations).

                <p>
                    Six Acts is a UK-based initiative, so if you are not a UK resident your information may be transferred
                    across borders when you use the Platform. We have put in place measures to comply with laws regulating
                    cross-border transfers.
                    By using the platform you consent to the transfer of your personal information to the UK which may
                    have different data protection rules from those of your country. In certain circumstances, courts,
                    law enforcement agencies, regulatory agencies, or security authorities in the UK  may be entitled to
                    access your personal information.
